## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to enhance 3D muscle imaging by combining robotic precision with motion tracking. The KUKA iiwa 14, known for its safety and compliance in human-robot interaction, is used to hold and maneuver an imaging probe. The OptiTrack motion capture system provides accurate tracking of the subjectâ€™s movement, allowing the robot to dynamically adjust and maintain optimal imaging alignment.
