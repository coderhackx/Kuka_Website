# Overview

This is a static website showcasing a system that integrates the KUKA iiwa 14 robotic arm with an OptiTrack motion capture system for motion-aware imaging. The robot holds and maneuvers the imaging probe with precision, while OptiTrack tracks subject movement in real time. The website provides an overview of how the system works, its features, and its capabilities in improving imaging accuracy and repeatability, all presented in a lightweight, static format for easy access and fast loading.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to enhance 3D muscle imaging by combining robotic precision with motion tracking. The KUKA iiwa 14, known for its safety and compliance in human-robot interaction, is used to hold and maneuver an imaging probe. The OptiTrack motion capture system provides accurate tracking of the subject’s movement, allowing the robot to adjust and maintain optimal imaging alignment dynamically.

## Features
- **Robotic Precision:** The KUKA iiwa 14 provides compliant, safe, and accurate probe positioning.
- **Motion Compensation:** A sticky navigation bar with smooth scrolling to different sections of the site.
- **Hero Section:** Built-in compliance and safety mechanisms of the KUKA arm.

- **Adaptive Imaging:** The probe dynamically adjusts to maintain the correct imaging angle and depth.
- **Projects Section:** Displays a list of recent projects with descriptions and images.
- **Safe Human-Robot Interaction:** Built-in compliance and safety mechanisms of the KUKA arm.
- **Visualization Support:** Captures imaging data for further analysis and 3D reconstruction.
