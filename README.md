# Overview

The system is designed to enhance imaging accuracy by uniting robotic precision with motion awareness. The KUKA iiwa 14 serves as the manipulator for holding and maneuvering the imaging probe, ensuring steady and repeatable positioning. At the same time, the OptiTrack motion capture system monitors subject movements, allowing the robot to automatically adjust and maintain optimal alignment during scanning.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to enhance 3D muscle imaging by combining robotic precision with motion tracking. The KUKA iiwa 14, known for its safety and compliance in human-robot interaction, is used to hold and maneuver an imaging probe. The OptiTrack motion capture system provides accurate tracking of the subject’s movement, allowing the robot to dynamically adjust and maintain optimal imaging alignment.

## Features
- **Robotic Precision:** The KUKA iiwa 14 provides compliant, safe, and accurate probe positioning.
- **Motion Compensation:** A sticky navigation bar with smooth scrolling to different sections of the site.
- **Hero Section:** Built-in compliance and safety mechanisms of the KUKA arm.

- **Adaptive Imaging:** The probe dynamically adjusts to maintain the correct imaging angle and depth.
- **Projects Section:** Displays a list of recent projects with descriptions and images.
- **Safe Human-Robot Interaction:** Built-in compliance and safety mechanisms of the KUKA arm.
- **Visualization Support:** Captures imaging data for further analysis and 3D reconstruction.
